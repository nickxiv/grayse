# To run a file written in Grayse
 1. Compile files typing "make" using provided makefile or typing javac Evaluation.java
 2. Type run FFFF or gray FFFF where FFFF is your Grayse file name.
 3. Done!

 ### Some programs provided in src/tests can help guide you on your path of learning about Grayse!


## Grayse is composed of several modules, with each one being testable.


## The first module is "Scanner"
## Usage is "scanner FFFF" where FFFF is the name of a file written in Grayse

## Step by step scanner usage:
 1. Compile Scanner.java using provided makefile or typing javac Scanner.java
 2. Type scanner FFFF where FFFF is your Grayse file name
 3. Done!

## The second module is "Recognizer"
## Usage is "recognizer FFFF" where FFFF is the name of a file written in Grayse

## Step by step recognizer usage:
 1. Compile Recognizer.java using provided makefile or typing javac Recognizer.java
 2. Type recognizer FFFF where FFFF is your Grayse file name
 3. Done!

## The third module is "Environments"
## Usage is "environments"
## This class tests functionality of building environments using a hard-coded testing

## Step by step environments usage:
 1. Compile Environments.java using provided makefile or typing javac Environments.java
 2. Type environments
 3. Done!

## The fourth module is "Pretty Printer"
## Usage is "pp FFFF" where FFFF is the name of a file written in Grayse
## This class builds a parse tree of lexeme and prints them in order (not pretty)

## Step by step pretty printer usage:
 1. Compile PP.java using provided makefile or typing javac PP.java
 2. Type recognizer FFFF where FFFF is your Grayse file name
 3. Done!



## With the provided makefile, typing "make" will compile all java classes.
## "make clean" will delete all .class .pp.* files
